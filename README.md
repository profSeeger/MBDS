<h3>Software</h3>
QGIS Application: (https://qgis.org/en/site/) click the 'Download Now' button and then for your OS download the 3.4.x version of the software for the workshop. This will get you the most stable version of QGIS. 
For Windows users, select the Satandalone installer for 3.4.x (not the OSGeo link!)
